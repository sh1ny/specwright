# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A bumped version is greater than main's before it merges
`release.sh check --main <ref>` SHALL refuse, before any write, a branch that bumped (its version differs from its merge base with `<ref>`, or the newest of its own non-merge commits that changed the primary file's version raised it) to a version not greater than `<ref>`'s, naming both versions and saying to bump again. No readable version at `<ref>` SHALL pass. A primary file that exists but does not read exactly one version is unreadable, which is not absent. An unreadable merge base or parent SHALL count as a bump only when the branch's or commit's version is not among the versions it matched.

#### Scenario: Two changes bump to the same version
- **WHEN** branches `feat/a` and `feat/b` both start at 0.4.2 and bump to 0.5.0, `feat/a` has merged, and ship runs for `feat/b` with `origin/main` at 0.5.0
- **THEN** `check --main origin/main` exits non-zero naming 0.5.0 on the branch and on `origin/main`, nothing is pushed, and the message says to bump `feat/b` again

#### Scenario: Main moved past the bump
- **WHEN** the branch bumped from 0.4.2 to 0.5.0 and `origin/main` is at 0.6.0
- **THEN** the check exits non-zero naming 0.5.0 and 0.6.0

#### Scenario: Bump still ahead
- **WHEN** the branch bumped from 0.4.2 to 0.5.0 and `origin/main` is still at 0.4.2
- **THEN** the check exits 0 and reports version 0.5.0

#### Scenario: Version file edited without a bump
- **WHEN** a change branch edits the primary file but leaves its version at 0.4.2, and `origin/main` has moved to 0.5.0
- **THEN** the check exits 0: an edit that keeps the version is not a bump

#### Scenario: Bump reverted on the branch
- **WHEN** a change branch bumped 0.4.2 to 0.5.0, a later commit set it back to 0.4.2, and `origin/main` has moved to 0.5.0
- **THEN** the check exits 0: the branch carries no bump

#### Scenario: Branch did not bump
- **WHEN** a change branch leaves the version at 0.4.2 and `origin/main` has moved to 0.5.0
- **THEN** the check exits 0 and refuses nothing, since the branch carries no release of its own

#### Scenario: Main was merged into the branch after the duplicate landed
- **WHEN** `feat/a` and `feat/b` both bumped 0.4.2 to 0.5.0, `feat/a` merged, and `origin/main` was then merged into `feat/b`
- **THEN** `check --main origin/main` exits non-zero naming 0.5.0 on the branch and on `origin/main`, and says to bump again

#### Scenario: Main has no version yet
- **WHEN** the branch adds `VERSION` at 0.1.0 with `release.enabled`, and `origin/main` has no `VERSION` file
- **THEN** the check exits 0 and reports version 0.1.0

#### Scenario: Merge base repeats the version
- **WHEN** the merge base's `VERSION` holds `0.4.2` twice, the branch's only commit on it removes the duplicate and keeps `0.4.2`, and `origin/main` has moved to 0.5.0
- **THEN** `check --main origin/main` exits 0 and reports version 0.4.2: the branch did not bump

#### Scenario: Bump after a repair of an unreadable version
- **WHEN** the merge base's `VERSION` holds `0.4.2` twice, one branch commit removes the duplicate, a later one bumps to 0.5.0, and `origin/main` is at 0.5.0
- **THEN** the check exits non-zero with `version_not_ahead_of_main`, naming 0.5.0 on the branch and on `origin/main`

#### Scenario: One commit repairs and bumps
- **WHEN** the merge base's `VERSION` holds `0.4.2` twice, the branch's only commit on it writes `0.5.0` once, and `origin/main` is at 0.5.0
- **THEN** the check exits non-zero with `version_not_ahead_of_main`, naming 0.5.0 on the branch and on `origin/main`
